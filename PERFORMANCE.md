# Noxxi Performance Optimization Guide

## Key Performance Features Implemented

### 1. Image Optimization
- **Smart Caching**: Images cached up to 100MB with automatic cleanup
- **Scroll-aware Loading**: Images cancel loading during fast scroll
- **Preloading**: Next 3 images preloaded for smooth scrolling
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cache clearing on low memory

### 2. Scroll Performance
- **60fps Target**: Lightweight widgets and minimal rebuilds
- **Velocity Tracking**: Detects fast scrolling to optimize loading
- **Keys**: Using ValueKey on event cards for efficient updates
- **Keep Alive**: Loaded images stay in memory while visible

### 3. Memory Management
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Runs every 5 minutes
- **Lifecycle Aware**: Cleans cache when app is backgrounded
- **Low Memory Handling**: Aggressive cleanup on memory warnings
- **Debug Monitor**: Shows real-time memory usage (debug mode only)

## Performance Best Practices

### DO:
- Use `PerformanceImage` for all network images
- Pass ScrollController to images for scroll-aware loading
- Use keys on list items for efficient updates
- Preload critical images before they're visible
- Monitor memory usage in debug mode

### DON'T:
- Load full resolution images for thumbnails
- Create heavy widgets in build methods
- Use complex animations during scroll
- Cache unlimited images without cleanup
- Block the main thread with heavy operations

## Monitoring Performance

### Debug Mode
- Performance monitor shows in top-right corner
- Displays: Image count, Memory usage, Live images
- Updates every 2 seconds

### Production
- Memory manager runs automatically
- Logs cleanup actions to console
- Handles low memory gracefully

## Future Optimizations

1. **Image Compression**: Serve different sizes based on widget size
2. **Lazy Loading**: Load event details only when needed
3. **Virtual Scrolling**: Only render visible items
4. **Background Loading**: Use isolates for heavy operations
5. **CDN Integration**: Use edge caching for images

## Testing Performance

```bash
# Profile mode for accurate performance
flutter run --profile

# Check memory usage
flutter analyze

# Monitor widget rebuilds
flutter inspector
```

## Target Metrics
- Scroll FPS: 60fps consistently
- Image Load Time: <500ms on 4G
- Memory Usage: <150MB average
- Cache Hit Rate: >80%
- App Launch: <2 seconds
